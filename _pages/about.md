Welcome to Jasorsi's personal website. I am a PhD student at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) in [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), USA. I am currently working with Professor [Aniket Bera](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ab/) on computer vision and human computer interaction problems.

Research Interest
---------
My broad region of interest is 3D Vision and Recognition, Vision based Robot Control, Machine Vision, Human Computer Interface, and related Computer Vision aspects. I have experience of working with LiDAR data for 3D scene reconstruction and presenting a vectorized model of the objects in the environment. I am also interested in exploring the interactions of occlusion on object tracking and impact of odometry in navigation and control. 

Background
---------
I have 3 years of work experience at [Samsung Semiconductor India Research and Development Center](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b) in Bangalore, India, working on low power ARM cpu's physical design cycle. My flavor of work at SSIR dealt with machine learning and [EDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_design_automation) tools on the pretext of nano-scale 3D geometry, circuit theory, and semiconductor device characteristics. I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the [Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/view_department.php?deptid=84) at [Jadavpur University](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/), India in 2019. At Jadavpur University, I was affiliated with [Imaging, Vision & Pattern Recognition Group(IVPR)](https://sites.google.com/site/ivprgroup/home-page-ivpr?authuser=0)'s efforts aligned with machine vision problems primarily focused on real-time 3D scene reconstruction from LiDAR data. At IVPR, I worked with Professor [Ananda Shankar Chowdhury](https://sites.google.com/site/anandachowdhury/) and Professor [Sanjoy Kumar Saha](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=MVooqJUAAAAJ&hl=en).
