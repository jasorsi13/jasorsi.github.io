 * Establishment of a pipeline for real time reconstruction of geometric objects from point cloud data. Fast surface segmentation, semantic labeling, and object grouping are the major constituting subjects of the pipeline

Surface feature extraction and classification: After formation of surface segments they are to be classified to assign a semantic label. A feature vector fl is formed  for all unique labels l in L. For a cloud the list of such vectors is stored in the map F = {< fl, sl > ∀ unique l ∈ L} where sl is the semantic class corresponding to all points with label l. For classification, a number of classifiers have been tried as discussed below. During training sl is supplied to the classifier and during testing the classifier reports the sl for an fl. For all the segments the feature vectors are formed using Algorithm 3. The concatenated histogram of surface normals of a segment along with the surface density form the feature to represent the semantic. Each of the surface normal histograms hi, hj and hk is a distribution of the ˆi,ˆj and kˆ components respectively of all surface normals of a segment. The histograms are b-dimensional. For the present work, we have empirically set the value of b as 16 . Let x stands for a normal component . Then, the function B(x) as used in the algorithm determines the bin in the corresponding histogram hx. The present work is concerned with semantic differentiation between different types of surface namely “plane”,“ground plane”, “cylinder”, “sphere” and “cone”. If an environment can be defined as a composition of such basic generator surfaces then with supervised combination of surfaces, complex models can be estimated. Also surface like “ground plane” has immediate use in robot navigation. It can be observed from Algorithm 2 that the histograms are normalized individually. This is done in order to prevent bias towards a particular component as the surface is composed of normals with variances differing for the components. The density factor also helps to bias the classifier towards correcting the labels of bigger segment proposals. During training the label of a feature vector is chosen as the one corresponding to the majority of points in it. Due to local contextual surface propagation logic it may happen that different surfaces with a smooth transition may come under the same segment, the majority voting mitigates the effect of bad labeling in such cases. The proposed methodology uses a statistical approach to prepare surface segment proposals and subsequently use them for semantic label prediction using classical classifier i.e. feature is not learnt rather engineered. This provides an insight into the structural properties of point cloud from spinning Lidar. Though deep classifiers are becoming popular, point cloud segmentation using them are computationally very expensive and requires sophisticated hardware. The proposed approach on the other hand can work on low configuration hardware providing decent accuracy, without sacrificing much on speed.

Conclusion 
  The present work deals with the problem of semantic surface segmentation from Lidar point cloud data. The proposed methodology has a novel fast meshing process that   generates surface mesh from the Lidar scan in an online fashion, facilitating fast computation of surface normals. Subsequently a statistical method generates         segment proposals. The proposals are described with a novel feature vector based on the distribution of surface normals. Semantic labelling is done by feeding the     feature vector as input to classifier. The performance of the proposed methodology is compared with some popular cloud segmentation methods. It is observed that the   proposed methodology is significantly faster and provides higher classification accuracy. It can be concluded that the proposed methodology can deliver acceptable     accuracy for robotic applications in real time and paves the way for further utilization of semantic surfaces towards generation of models and scene reconstruction.
