 * Establishment of a pipeline for real time reconstruction of geometric objects from point cloud data. Fast surface segmentation, semantic labeling, and object grouping are the major constituting subjects of the pipeline

This is an extension of our previous work [Real time Geometry Extraction and Vectorization of Objects from Point-Cloud Data (PART 1)](https://jasorsi13.github.io/jasorsi.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1).

Conclusion 
  The present work deals with the problem of semantic surface segmentation from Lidar point cloud data. The proposed methodology has a novel fast meshing process that   generates surface mesh from the Lidar scan in an online fashion, facilitating fast computation of surface normals. Subsequently a statistical method generates         segment proposals. The proposals are described with a novel feature vector based on the distribution of surface normals. Semantic labelling is done by feeding the     feature vector as input to classifier. The performance of the proposed methodology is compared with some popular cloud segmentation methods. It is observed that the   proposed methodology is significantly faster and provides higher classification accuracy. It can be concluded that the proposed methodology can deliver acceptable     accuracy for robotic applications in real time and paves the way for further utilization of semantic surfaces towards generation of models and scene reconstruction.
