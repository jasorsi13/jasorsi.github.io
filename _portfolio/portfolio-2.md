JUSC is a student body initiative under the TEQIP program for students from different backgrounds to interact and nurture their interests focused on scientific  experiment, Robot building, circuits. I was an active member of the club. I collaborated with other members in robot building, designing actuators for robotics applications, and computer vision applications. Later I mentored young members in the club with our viewpoints and pragmatic learnings. 

A brief [highlight of my adventures](https://github.com/jasorsi13/jasorsi.github.io/blob/master/files/JUSC%20projects.pdf) can be found in the following paragraphs. You are encouraged to visit their [official website](https://www.jusc.co.in/) to get to know about their present interests.

Timeline: December 2015
Description: A two dimensional space scanner capable of reconstructing the real time view ahead of the sensor. Synchronized ultrasonic wave pulses were used to scan the environment upfront.
