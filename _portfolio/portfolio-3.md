Blensor is a software solution or a package capable of doing sensor simulation in Blender environment. Primary focus of the tool is around the Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR/LADAR) and Kinect sensors. More about them can be found in their [official website](https://www.blensor.org/). 

We can import a scene and simulate the velodyne sensor scan and store it through this package, following are two snippets.
