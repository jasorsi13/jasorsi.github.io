Blensor is a software solution or a package capable of doing sensor simulation in Blender environment. Primary focus of the tool is around the Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR/LADAR) and Kinect sensors. More about them can be found in their [official website](https://www.blensor.org/). 

We can import a scene and simulate the velodyne sensor scan and store it through this package, following are two snippets.
       
Import a scene. <br/>

Perform the velodyne sensor simulation and store it. <br/>

 For our 3D scene reconstruction I have created a dataset that is annotated with the following nomenclature of different surfaces of “plane”, “ground plane”,
“cylinder”, “sphere” and “cone” are colored as red, off white, blue, green and gray respectively.

   We have created another form of dataset that was annotated based on difference in surface homogeneity.
