Blensor is a software solution or a package capable of doing sensor simulation in Blender environment. Primary focus of the tool is around the Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR/LADAR) and Kinect sensors. More about them can be found in their [official website](https://www.blensor.org/). 


1.[Reconstruction of the Azimuth Plane Using Ultrasonic Wave Echos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXxN-u29SSY)
   Timeline: December 2015
 * Description: A two dimensional space scanner capable of reconstructing the real time view ahead of the sensor. Synchronized ultrasonic wave pulses were used to scan      the environment upfront.

2.Artificially Intelligent Maze Solving Robot- Micromouse
   Timeline: January 2017
 * Description: A heuristic probability distribution based maze solving agent designed to reach a
   target grid location. The Robot used ultrasonic wave sensors to guide between the walls of the
   maze and used infrared LED based distance tracking method on the wheels to track the grids
   traveled in the maze. While traversing the grid the probability distribution map ( highlighted
   below) is used to take decision turns every time the agent is faced with multiple possible ways.
   If two or more ways have the same probability map value, values are chosen in a strict
   clockwise fashion. The agent usages a stack based tracking method to its previous relevant
   points of decision making to opt for the next priority way.
   The problem can be compared with the classical problem of depth first search in computer
   science where maze is the graph to be traversed. Choice of edges for prior travel are decided
   by the heuristic probability model. The agent only has the local neighborhood based and already
   traversed edgeâ€™s view of the graph.
