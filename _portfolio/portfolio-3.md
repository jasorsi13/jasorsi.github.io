JUSC is a student body initiative under the TEQIP program for students from different backgrounds to interact and nurture their interests focused on scientific  experiment, Robot building, circuits. I was an active member of the club. I collaborated with other members in robot building, designing actuators for robotics applications, and computer vision applications. Later I mentored young members in the club with our viewpoints and pragmatic learnings. 

A brief [highlight of my adventures](https://github.com/jasorsi13/jasorsi.github.io/blob/master/files/JUSC%20projects.pdf) can be found in the following paragraphs. You are encouraged to visit their [official website](https://www.jusc.co.in/) to get to know about their present interests. 

1.[Reconstruction of the Azimuth Plane Using Ultrasonic Wave Echos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXxN-u29SSY)
   Timeline: December 2015
 * Description: A two dimensional space scanner capable of reconstructing the real time view ahead of the sensor. Synchronized ultrasonic wave pulses were used to scan      the environment upfront.

2.Artificially Intelligent Maze Solving Robot- Micromouse
   Timeline: January 2017
 * Description: A heuristic probability distribution based maze solving agent designed to reach a
   target grid location. The Robot used ultrasonic wave sensors to guide between the walls of the
   maze and used infrared LED based distance tracking method on the wheels to track the grids
   traveled in the maze. While traversing the grid the probability distribution map ( highlighted
   below) is used to take decision turns every time the agent is faced with multiple possible ways.
   If two or more ways have the same probability map value, values are chosen in a strict
   clockwise fashion. The agent usages a stack based tracking method to its previous relevant
   points of decision making to opt for the next priority way.
   The problem can be compared with the classical problem of depth first search in computer
   science where maze is the graph to be traversed. Choice of edges for prior travel are decided
   by the heuristic probability model. The agent only has the local neighborhood based and already
   traversed edgeâ€™s view of the graph.
